## :construction: Work in progress

A staging version of the app is running [on heroku](https://seven-wonders-online.herokuapp.com/).

It is still under development, so the staging server is unstable as the CI/CD pipeline deploys the new app on
it after every successful build of the master branch. Don't play serious games there! :smile:
