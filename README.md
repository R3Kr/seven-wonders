An digital version of the famous 7 Wonders board game.

We do not own the rights on the Seven Wonder game concept and rules, nor on the assets used here.

A very early version of the app is running [here on heroku](https://seven-wonders-online.herokuapp.com/).
It is of course still under development and not usable yet.

Also, it is very unstable as it is a staging server where the app is redeployed after every successful build 
of the master branch.
